      <h2>what is Git</h2>
      <p>Git is a version control system which lets you track changes you make to your files over time. With Git, you can revert to various states of your files (like a time traveling machine). You can also make a copy of your file, make changes to that copy, and then merge these changes to the original copy.</p>
      <p>For example, you could be working on a website's landing page and discover that you do not like the navigation bar. But at the same time, you might not want to start altering its components because it might get worse.</p>
      <p>With Git, you can create an identical copy of that file and play around with the navigation bar. Then, when you are satisfied with your changes, you can merge the copy to the original file.</p>
      <p>You are not limited to using Git just for source code files – you can also use it to keep track of text files or even images. This means that Git is not just for developers – anyone can find it helpful.</p>

      <p>you can download Git for free from the following website: https://www.git-scm.com/</p>
      <h2>Using Git with Command Line</h2>
      <p>To start using Git, we are first going to open up our Command shell.
        For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in terminal.  
        The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is properly installed:</p>
      <h2>Configure Git</h2>
      <article> ]
        <p>I will assume that at this point you have installed Git. To verify this, you can run this command on the command line: git --version. This shows you the current version installed on you PC.
        </p>     
        <p>The next thing you'll need to do is to set your username and email address. Git will use this information to identify who made specific changes to files</p>
        <p>To set your username, type and execute these commands: git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME" and git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL". Just make sure to replace "YOUR_USERNAME" and "YOUR_EMAIL" with the values you choose.</p>

      <h2>Git Adding New Files</h2>
      <p>You just created your first local Git repo. But it is empty.
        So let's add some files, or create a new file using your favourite text editor. Then save or move it to the folder you just created.
